### Custom origins for PaperMC

<div class="markdown-body card"><div><div><div><h1>GenesisMC</h1>
<p>This is the PaperMC origins plugin made my PurpleWolfMC!
This is a custom rewrite of the origins mod, but in plugin form. Credit to <a href="https://modrinth.com/user/Apace" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">Apace100</a> for the original mod, true legend. Thank you for your hard work. <u>The plugin is for PaperMC servers, but will still load on Bukkit and SpigotMC, but most features WILL break.</u></p>
<p></p>
<p><font color="#f00900"><i>WARNING:</i></font> Most features of the plugin do not work because it is still in very early alpha. Bugs will be there and some origins will not work.</p>
<hr>
<p>After the full release, more origins will be added. The plugin is still in early beta, so some functionalities are still not working yet. This plugin is 100% open source for all of its versions. This plugin aims to add plugin support to PaperMC and all forks of that in an extremely detailed an efficient way. If you are wanting the customization of origins like an easy drop in datapack, this plugin currently does not support that. However, if you do want that, I suggest you check out the Origins-Bukkit plugin. This plugin is only for the purpose of an easy drop in plugin for spigot servers without the need of libraries and other external features. This plugin also plans to be fully compatible with tons of other plugins.</p>
<p>There are currently 18 origins in the main plugin. More origins will be added in the future with the option to disable those specific origins.</p><details><summary>Included Origins (18)</summary>
