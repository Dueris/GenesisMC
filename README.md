GenesisMC is a port of the Origins mod onto Paper servers. With our fundamental goal of accessibility, we strive to make a truly universal experience, for java and bedrock players. Utilizing plugins such as <a href="https://geysermc.org">GeyserMC</a> and <a href="https://github.com/GeyserMC/Floodgate">Floodgate</a> whilst developing with bedrock players in mind means that anyone from any device can play. Furthermore, we have committed to added multi language support to our plugin so that you can play, no matter what.

Custom origins are what truly made the Origins mod shine; therefore, we are making custom origins the end goal for our plugin. With a basic form of custom origin support expected to release and be improved over the next few alpha versions. If you want to know more please visit our <a href="http://genesismc.duckdns.org">wiki page!</a> We have even gone as far as to add some of the most popular custom origins right into the plugin, so you donâ€™t have to add them yourself!

<hr><h3>What is GenesisMC Compatible With?</h3><p style="
    text-align: center;
">
<hr>
    GenesisMC is compatible with PaperMC, Folia, and GeyserMC and Floodgate. Unfortunately, the plugin uses the PaperAPI, meaning that the plugin can load on Spigot and CraftBukkit, however many of the features will break.
