<p>This is the PaperMC origins plugin made by Dueris! This is a plugin version of the Origins Mod. Credit to <a href="https://modrinth.com/user/Apace" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">Apace100</a> for the original mod, true legend. Thank you for your hard work. <u>The plugin is for PaperMC servers, but will still load on Bukkit and SpigotMC, but most features WILL break.

<p></p>

There is a Folia build being developed, it will use a different jar file. It will be included in all updates.</u></p>

<p><font color="#f00900"><i>WARNING:</i></font> Most features of the plugin do not work because it is still in very early alpha. Bugs will be there and some origins will not work.</p>

<hr>

<p>After the full release, more origins will be added. The plugin is still in early alpha, so some functionalities are still not working yet. This plugin is 100% open source for all of its versions. This plugin aims to add plugin support to PaperMC and all forks of that in an extremely detailed an efficient way. If you are wanting the customization of origins like an easy drop in datapack, this plugin currently does not support that. However, if you do want that, I suggest you check out the Origins-Bukkit plugin. This plugin is only for the purpose of an easy drop in plugin for spigot servers without the need of libraries and other external features. This plugin also plans to be fully compatible with tons of other plugins.</p>

<p>There are currently 18 origins in the main plugin. More origins will be added in the future with the option to disable those specific origins.

<p>The docs page includes everything about the origins, and information to make custom origins. <a href="https://genesismc.gitbook.io" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">https://genesismc.gitbook.io</a></p>

</p>

<p>This plugin runs on a custom API that is built into the plugin to make things more detailed and efficient. It also has normally quick support and moderation. The updates for the plugin are frequent and the updates are made to the quality of which is completed to the best of my abilities at that time. They will always be updated as I learn more. Bug fixes also come frequently. Its also a big priority of mine to give the most quality and customization to the plugin without everything being too complicated.</p><hr>

<h3>Disclaimer</h3>

<p>ATM, custom origins is impossible with the plugin. Development is currently focused on the "CORE" release of the plugin(1.0.1). After that development will begin for the "CUSTOM ORIGINS" release(2.0.1).</p><hr>
