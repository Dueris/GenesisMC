## GenesisMC

<h5>Bringing custom origins to PaperMC, Vanilla clients, and Geyser</h5>
<br>
<p>GenesisMC is a plugin designed to seamlessly integrate the popular Origins mod into the PaperMC environment. Over the course of a year in development, the plugin has evolved to become a feature-rich addon, offering an immersive and dynamic gameplay experience.</p>
<br>
<p align="left">Genesis incorporates the Origins mod into the server, allowing players to choose from a variety of origins with unique abilities, traits, and playstyles, and even incorporating our own custom origins!</p>
<p align="left">The plugin goes beyond the impossible, and FAR beyond just including the existing origins, providing a powerful and efficient framework for server admins to add/create their own custom origins! Genesis supports all custom origins from the original mod, and even adds a few of its own powers and conditions!</p>
<p align="left">Genesis tries to go beyond whats possible to make every player that encounters it has an unforgettable experience.</p>
