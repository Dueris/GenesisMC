        <h4>
        Thank you to everyone who contributed to this version. This version took AGES to make, and without the help of the fabulous Java MC community, this update wouldnt even be close to being done.
        Thank you to @zermin(Tye) for creating the Custom Origins parsing code, @zekihvh(Zeki) for creating item bug patches, and @onechris(Chris) for testing bedrock compatibility and providing condition contributions, and to Apace for allowing me to do this project.

        The plugin wouldnt be where it is today without them. Thank you to you all, and enjoy GenesisMC 0.2.1
